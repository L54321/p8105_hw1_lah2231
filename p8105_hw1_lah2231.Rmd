```{r, echo = FALSE}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
#View(penguins)

The different species of penguins the dataset looks at are: `r unique(penguins$species)`. They live in one of the following places or islands: `r unique(penguins$island)`. There are `r nrow(penguins)` rows. The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` mm.
